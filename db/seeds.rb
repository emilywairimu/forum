# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# User.create!(
#   username: 'admin',
#   password: 'admin_password',
#   admin_privileges: true,
#   created_at: Time.now,
#   updated_at: Time.now
# )

# User.create!(
#   username: 'user1',
#   password: 'user1_password',
#   admin_privileges: false,
#   created_at: Time.now,
#   updated_at: Time.now
# )
